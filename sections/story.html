            HELLO, I’M LAUREN AND AS A LIFELONG ADVENTUROUS EATER,
            I’VE TRIED A LOT OF CRAZY THINGS,
            BUT I NEVER THOUGHT HOT SAUCE IN COFFEE WAS
            A SANE OPTION UNTIL A FRIEND DARED ME TO TRY IT.

            AND IT SUCKED.
        </p>
        <p class="story__text">
            BUT I WONDERED IF THERE WAS A WAY TO ADD
            SPICE TO MY COFFEE. WHEN THERE WAS NO EASY
            SOLUTION, UJJO WAS BORN.

            UJJO (OOO-JOE): THE WORD FOR “FIRE” IN KONKANI,
            SPOKEN ON THE WEST COAST OF INDIA, IS AN HOMAGE
            AND A LOVE LETTER TO MY DAD, AN INDIAN IMMIGRANT
            WHO INSTILLED A FIRE IN MY PALATE – AND MY
            HEART – FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
